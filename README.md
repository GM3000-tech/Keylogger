# Keylogger
# Barebones Python Keylogger

This is the **starting point** of my keylogger project — a minimal, portable Python script that logs keystrokes with timestamps to a simple text file.

## What It Does

- Listens to all keyboard input while running  
- Records each key press along with the current time  
- Saves the log to `keylog.txt` in the same directory  
- Stops recording when you press the **ESC** key

## Why This Repo Exists

This is the barebones/meat of the project — no stealth, encryption, or advanced features. It’s designed to be:
- Easy to understand and modify  
- Compatible across Windows, macOS, and Linux  
- A foundation for future development and experimentation

## How to Run      

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended)  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pynput`  
3. Run the script: `python keylogger.py`  
4. To stop logging, press the **ESC** key  
5. View the logged keys in `keylog.txt`
